            Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I'm
            sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything

            I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth.
            Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three
            hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks.
            Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Why did you bring us here?

            That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? OK, if everyone's

            will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Um, is this the boring,

            Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get
            dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to
            use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, whatcha
            watching?
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, I like a challenge. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until
            everyone died. As an interesting side note, as a head without a
            body, I envy the dead. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Oh
            yeah, good luck with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No, of course not. It
            was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. These
            old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not
            knowing where they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Oh, I always feared he might
            run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? No, of
            course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. I wish! It's a
            nickel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is that a cooking show? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Now
            what? Pansy. You lived before you met me?! Take me to your leader!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! The
            key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You
            will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I'll tell
            them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead
            finger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ooh, name it after me! Professor, make a woman out of me. No
            argument here. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Wow, you got
            that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to
            download pornography.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Nay, I respect and
            admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
            Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Kif, I have mated
            with a woman. Inform the men.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are their names? We're also Santa Claus! Ow, my spirit! Yeah,
            and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat."
            And "Put on your good vestments." We'll need to have a look inside
            you with this camera.
